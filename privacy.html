      <p>
        The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big
        deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why;
        how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we
        never sell your data: never have, never will.
      </p>

      <p>
        This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Enquist
        Technologies GmbH including RecruitingDone.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect and why</h2>

      <p>
        Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that
        means in practice:
      </p>

      <h3>Identity &amp; access</h3>

      <p>
        When you sign up for a Enquist Technologies GmbH. products, we typically
        ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and
        maybe a phone number. That’s just so you can personalize your new
        account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential
        information. We often also give you the option to add a profile picture
        that displays in our products, but we do not normally look at or access
        that picture. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and
        we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your
        permission either.
      </p>

      <h3>Billing information</h3>

      <p>
        When you pay for a Enquist Technologies GmbH. products, we ask for your
        credit card and billing address. That’s so we can charge you for
        service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is
        passed directly to our payment processor and doesn't ever go through our
        servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the
        last 4 digits of the credit card number and as-of billing address, for
        account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing
        address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States or VAT in
        the EU, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on
        your invoices.
      </p>

      <h3>Geolocation data</h3>

      <p>
        We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can
        always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login
        data for as long as your product account is active.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also log full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. We keep
        this record forever because they are used to mitigate spammy signups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions
        section — are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with
        troubleshooting cases. We blind all web analytics data after 90 days.
      </p>

      <h3>Website interactions</h3>

      <p>
        When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser
        automatically shares certain information such as which operating system
        and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with
        the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred
        you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new
        designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some
        design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address
        and user account if applicable and you are signed into our Services. We
        blind all of these individual identifiers after 90 days.
      </p>

      <p>We do use third-party web analytics software. Google Analytics.</p>

      <h3>Anti-bot assessments</h3>

      <p>
        We use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> services as
        a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting
        our app and the broader Internet community from spam. When you fill
        specific forms, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g
        IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements)
        to check whether the data is possibly filled out by an automated program
        instead of a human. We retain these data via our subprocessor forever
        because they are used for anti-spam mitigation.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies and Do Not Track</h3>

      <p>
        We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences,
        make it easier for you to use our applications, and support some
        analytics. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it
        remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can
        adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more
        about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how
        to manage and delete them, please visit:
        <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org"
          >https://www.allaboutcookies.org</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Voluntary correspondence</h3>

      <p>
        When you write Enquist Technologies GmbH. with a question or to ask for
        help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that
        we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out
        in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when
        we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the
        conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your
        express consent.
      </p>

      <h3>Information we do not collect</h3>

      <p>
        We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications
        including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender
        identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or
        disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you
        include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into
        our Support team.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to
        add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you
        or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not
        extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use
        alone.
      </p>

      <h2>When we access or share your information</h2>

      <p>
        Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times
        we’ll ever access or share your info are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>To provide products or services you've requested</b>. We do use
          some third-party services to run our applications and only to the
          extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via
          these third parties. You can view the list of third-party services we
          use in each product. Having subprocessors means we are using
          technology to access your data. No Enquist Technologies GmbH. human
          looks at your data for these purposes. We also use some other
          processors for other business functions, such as Stripe and Xero.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your
            permission.</b
          >
          If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a
          Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted
            uses.</b
          >
          Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a
          measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy
          and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to
          us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the
          process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted
          purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
        </li>
        <li><b>When required under applicable law.</b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Enquist Technologies GmbH. is a US company and all data infrastructure
        are located in the US.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If US law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal
          subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply.
          Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests from local and federal law
          enforcement when they seek data. And unless we’re legally prevented
          from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made. In the
          event a government authority outside the US approaches Enquist
          Technologies GmbH with a request, our default stance is to refuse
          unless the US government compels us to comply through procedures
          outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, if Enquist Technologies GmbH. receives a request to
          preserve data, we refuse unless compelled by either the US Federal
          Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f) or a properly
          served US subpoena for civil matters. In both of these situations, we
          have to comply. In these situations, we notify affected customers as
          soon as possible unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. We do
          not share preserved data unless absolutely required under the Stored
          Communications Act or compelled by a court order that we choose not to
          appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order,
          or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we
          destroy any preserved copies we made of customer data once the
          preservation period lapses.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or
          entity, we do not assist.
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>
          If you are an account owner who wants to export data from their
          accounts, you can do so directly by contacting our support team.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Finally, if Enquist Technologies GmbH. is acquired by or merged with
        another company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll
        notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes
        subject to a different privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights with respect to your information</h2>

      <p>
        At Enquist Technologies GmbH., we apply the same data rights to all
        customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most
        privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General
        Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act
        (“CCPA”) in the US. Enquist Technologies GmbH. recognizes all of the
        rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable
        law. These rights include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Know.</b> You have the right to know what personal
          information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the
          categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they
          are used, in this privacy policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right of Access.</b> This includes your right to access the
          personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain
          information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of
          that information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Correction.</b> You have the right to request correction
          of your personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.</b> This is your right to
          request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that
          your personal information be erased from our possession and, by
          extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data
          deletion requests may prevent you from using Enquist Technologies GmbH
          services because our applications may then no longer work. In such
          cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Complain.</b> You have the right to make a complaint
          regarding our handling of your personal information with the
          appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority
          or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to
          <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en"
            >https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Restrict Processing.</b> This is your right to request
          restriction of how and why your personal information is used or
          processed, including opting out of sale of personal information.
          (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Object.</b> You have the right, in certain situations, to
          object to how or why your personal information is processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Portability.</b> You have the right to receive the
          personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to
          another party.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</b> You have
          the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal,
          or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based
          on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the
          decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and
          us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit
          consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Non-Discrimination.</b> This right stems from the CCPA. We
          do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products,
          offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer
          service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However,
          the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”)
          may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using
          our Services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly
        updating your account information.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance,
        please contact us at [privacy@recruiting-done.com or at Enquist
        Technologies GmbH, Gutstrasse 123, 8055 Zürich. For requests to delete
        personal information or know what personal information has been
        collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at
        least two pieces of information already collected including your user
        email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf,
        we will first need written consent with a signature from the account
        holder before proceeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a
        complaint or find out more about GDPR, at
        <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en"
          >https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>How we secure your data</h2>

      <p>
        All data is encrypted via
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"
          >SSL/TLS</a
        >
        when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups
        are also encrypted.
      </p>

      <p>
        For all products except, most data are not encrypted while they live in
        our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need
        it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.
      </p>

      <h2>What happens when you delete data in your product accounts</h2>

      <p>
        In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash data.
        Anything you trash is no longer accessible via the application. We do
        have backups of our application databases, which are kept for up to
        another 90 days. In total, when you trash things in our applications,
        they are purged within 90 days from all of our systems and logs.
        Retrieving data for a single account from a backup is cost-prohibitive
        and unduly burdensome so if you change your mind you’ll need to do so
        before your data are deleted from our active servers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also delete your data after an account is cancelled. In this case,
        there is no period of data being kept in an accessible trash can so your
        data are purged within 60 days. This applies both for cases when an
        account owner directly cancels and for auto-cancelled accounts.

      <h2>Location of site and data</h2>

      <p>
        Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States.
        If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the
        United States,
        <b
          >please be aware that any information you provide to us will be
          transferred to and stored in the United States</b

      <h2>When transferring personal data from the EU</h2>

      <p>
        The GDPR requires that any data transferred out of the EU must be
        treated with the same level of protection that the EU privacy laws
        grant. The privacy laws of the United States generally do not meet that
        requirement. That is why Enquist Technologies GmbH. has voluntarily
        participated in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as well as the
        Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our data processing addendum include the European Commission’s Standard
        Contractual Clauses to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and
        obligations everywhere personal data is processed.
      </p>

      <h2>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy</h2>

      <p>
        The EU-US <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">Privacy Shield</a> is
        an agreement between certain European jurisdictions and the United
        States that up until July 16, 2020, allowed for the transfer of personal
        data from the EU to the US. Participation in the Privacy Shield program
        is voluntary. The Swiss-US Privacy Shield is a similar program for data
        transferred to the US from Switzerland and is still in effect.
      </p>

      <h3>
