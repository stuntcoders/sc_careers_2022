    <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-500">
      <p>
        From everyone at Enquist &amp; RecruitingDone, thank you for using our
        products &amp; services! We build them to help you do your best work.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, “Enquist”, or “us” in this document,
        we are referring to Enquist Technologies GmbH.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by
        Enquist Technologies GmbH. That includes RecruitingDone, whether
        delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile, or another
        format.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or
        organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the
        latest Terms of Service. That’s true for any of our existing and future
        products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There
        may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision
        of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or
        provision.
        <strong>These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a
        broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We
        do our best to deserve that trust by being open about
        <a href="/about/">who we are</a>, how we work, and keeping an open door
        to your <a href="/contact/">feedback</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Terms</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
          password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
          damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We
          recommend users set up two-factor authentication for added security.
          In some of our Services, we may require it.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
          under your account. That includes content posted by others who either:
          (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own
          logins under your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated
          methods are not permitted.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really
          free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for
          customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of
          trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in
          advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze
          your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If
          your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for
          auto-cancellation. See our
          <a href="/cancellation/">Cancellation policy</a> for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are upgrading, we will charge your card immediately and your
          billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or
          downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing
          cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
          taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
          behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
          authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes,
          levies, or duties.
        </li>
        <li>
          We process refunds according to our
          <a href="/refund/">Refund policy</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within
          each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked
          cancellation link. You can find instructions for how to cancel your
          account in our
          <a href="/cancellation-policy/">Cancellation policy</a>. An email or
          phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered
          cancellation. If you need help cancelling your account, you can always
          contact our <a href="/contact/">Support team</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately
          upon cancellation. Please check
          <a href="/cancellation-policy/">Cancellation policy</a> for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
          month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will
          not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in
          the last billing cycle. See our
          <a href="/refund-policy/">Refund policy</a> for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any
          and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any
          time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will
          not be able to access the account or any content in the account.
          Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or
          your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of
          all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the
          use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. There are
          some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we
          exercise that stance. For more details, see our Use
          <a href="/restrictions/">Restrictions policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse
          or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in
          immediate account termination.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Modifications to the Service and Prices</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do
        that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However,
        we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so,
        we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email
        address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our
        websites or the affected Services themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage
          significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the
          Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before
          taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may
          negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups,
          redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data
          transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where
          we may send your data through our network unencrypted.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that
          trust to heart. You agree that Enquist may process your data as
          described in our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> and for no
          other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following
          reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>To help you with support requests you make.</strong> We’ll
              ask for express consent before accessing your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an
                automated process partway through.</strong
              >
              We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix
              the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any
              personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum
              amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we
              aim to fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors
              from reoccurring.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To the extent required by applicable law.</strong> As a US
              company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only
              preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government
              authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the
              Stored Communications Act. If a non-US authority approaches
              Enquist for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the
              order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to
              comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal
              assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Enquist is audited by
              a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing
              information needed to complete the audit.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
          necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
          technology required to run the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Enquist is a
          “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to
          your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share
          with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in
          these Terms of Service, <a href="/privacy/">Privacy policy</a>, and
          other policies. We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that
          information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your
          explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with
          your requirements under the CCPA and not use Enquists’s Services in a
          way that violates the regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          These Service Terms incorporate the Enquists Data Processing Addendum
          (“DPA”), when the General Data Protection regulation (“GDPR”) applies
          to your use of Enquist Services to process Customer Data as defined in
          the DPA. The DPA is effective as of October 5, 2020 and replaces and
          supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you
          and Enquist Technologies GmbH. relating to the GDPR. If you prefer to
          have an executed copy of the Data Processing Addendum, you may contact
          us. Regardless of whether you execute or not, we protect and secure
          your data to the high standards set out in the addendum.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Copyright and Content Ownership</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide
          to the Services. All materials uploaded remain yours.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not pre-screen content, but reserve the right (but not the
          obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content
          that is available via the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          The names, look, and feel of the Services are copyright© to the
          Company. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse
          any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements
          without express written permission from the Company. You must request
          permission to use the Company’s logo or any Service logos for
          promotional purposes. Please email us requests to use logos. We
          reserve the right to rescind this permission if you violate these
          Terms of Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit
          any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the
          Services without the express written permission by the Company.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is
          associated with the Services or the Company.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Features and Bugs</h2>
      <p>
        We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the
        experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However,
        there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no
        guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As
        with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the
        bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any
        related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs in our software
        will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.
      </p>

      <h2>Liability</h2>
      <p>
        We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one
        section:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be
          liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any
          direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential,
          punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages
          for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses
          (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such
          damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the
          Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and
          services resulting from any goods, data, information or services
          purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered
          into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or
          alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct
          of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to
          this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of
          contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or
          any other theory of liability.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a
        bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do
        our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management
        of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent;
        and in general <a href="/about/">providing an actual care</a>. If you
        choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.
