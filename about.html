            The shortage of tech workers is a problem becoming bigger every year
            as pandemic has influenced the workforce to work remotely, thus
            offering employers to recruit employees globally. Instead of making
            it easier, companies are facing hard times navigating these complete
            challenges, innovating across different time-zones and attracting
            top talent.

            Those with dedicated recruitment teams will have a chance to fight
            back, but that leaves so many companies out of the game. Where do
            you start? How do you hire a recruiter?

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            After gaining MSc degree in Computer Science and ranking as top 3%
            Swiss software developers, I have decided to focus my time working
            on helping tech companies find the best talent, not only the one
            that passes tech qualifications, but the ones that will truly fit
            into company culture, and stay there for a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a long-term quality employees is truly an imperative in
            today's world and increases the quality of company delivery.
          </p>

          <h2>The Process</h2>
          <p>
            Our proprietary recruitment, training and onboarding process ensures
            that each client is matched with a carefully selected Recruiter
            Manager and is represented with a superior level of communication.
            Our Senior-level Tech team is there to examine results of online
            testing and perform video interviews. These clients now work only on
            approving the pre-selected candidates and onboarding processes.
