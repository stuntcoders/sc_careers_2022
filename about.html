            We love programming and creating software and take pride in working
            on this craft, working on ourselves continuously so that we’re
            better at it both as professionals in our own right and to our
            partners.

            We are StuntCoders, a software development company made from
            different passions, technologies and skills, united under a single
            promise — to be exceptional. Intelligent, curious and driven by
            discovery, collaboration is the foundation of our company and our
            work. We create eCommerce solutions that change how consumers
            interact with brands through well-thought-out architecture combined
            with pixel-perfect design and cutting-edge technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential to recognize that it is hard to accomplish great
            results without a great team. This is why we genuinely invest a lot
            in our team, and by that, we don’t mean bean bags, sweets or other
            perks, but investing real time and effort so that everybody’s job is
            made easier by team processes, not harder. But most important to us
            is that every team member is valued fairly and thoroughly, according
            to their contributions, not office politics.
          </p>
          <p>We love creating effective, well-built, outstanding solutions.</p>

          <!-- <h2>Our Partners</h2>
          <p>
            Many companies say that their clients are partners because they see
            them as more than just clients and because it sounds better (which
            it does).
          </p>
          <p>
            We do this as well, with a key difference being that our partners
            have been with us for as long as eight years. If doing business for
            that long isn’t a true partnership, we don’t know what is.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don’t do quick projects for a quick buck, and we return the trust
            our partners give us and are proud to have them:
          </p>
          <p>
            Our customers gave us five stars for our services and allowed us to
            run their stores for 10+ years. You might know some of them.
          </p>
