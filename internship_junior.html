      <h2>What can I expect from the internship?</h2>
      <p>
        The internship lasts 12 program weeks. That usually means three months,
        but we had people complete it sooner (our colleague Jovan completed it
        in 1.5 months), and we had people take longer (5-6 months).
      </p>
      <p>During the 12 weeks, you will learn about the following:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <ol>
          1. Work ethics.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          2. Self-quality control.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          3. Software development methodologies in practice
        </ol>
        <ol>
          4. Usage of project management tools, and lifecycle of tasks
        </ol>
        <ol>
          5. Tracking of changes and proper methods for versioning;
        </ol>
        <ol>
          6. Working with the team.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          7. Giving estimates.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          8. Proper git workflow (commit messages, branching models, peer
          reviews).
        </ol>
        <ol>
          9. Working with virtual environments (Docker, Vagrant, asdf).
        </ol>
        <ol>
          10. How to take team meetings.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          11. How to put your knowledge from SCSS to PHP to work on real
          projects. (Your commits will go to production, scary ðŸ‘»)
        </ol>

        <p>
          The internship is not a school, and the mentor is not your teacher. We
          expect you to have enough knowledge to follow through. Cheating on
          knowledge tests to pass qualifications will not do good.

      <h2>Whatâ€™s the difference between an Intern and a Junior Develper?</h2>
      <p>
        There is almost no difference in knowledge you must gain to qualify for
        Internship or Junior position. The difference may be in education, and
        readyness to start working at a full pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both interns and junior developers work on real-life features, that get
        deployed to production. Both give estimates, both are expected to work
        on the features on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference is that mentors ease interns into the projects,
        explaining all the nooks and cracks, with more than one weekly call on
        which details are presented. There is no pressure to deliver
        functionality on time (as interns are only practising estimates and are
        often awfully wrong), and there is more explaining and "holding hands".
      </p>

      <h2>How do I know if I qualify for a junior position or internship?</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a recent graduate (3+ university program) and havenâ€™t done
        any personal projects, this program might be the right thing for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should apply if you have just gained a degree (3+ university
        program) and have done some projects (personal, small, more significant,
        etc.). Then we will figure out together if you are fit for a junior
        position or if you should go through an internship program.
      </p>
      <p>We are always eager to meet people like you.</p>
      <p>
        If you have completed the course in PHP, Ruby, or front-end development,
        you must have at least one project you are proud of. Make it publicly
        available on a Git repo. We want to know how you think, how persistent
        you are, how much time it took you to complete the project, etc.
