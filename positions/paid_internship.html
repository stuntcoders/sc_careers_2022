<h2>Is it for me?</h2>
<p>
  If you are a recent graduate (3+ university program)&nbsp;and haven’t done any
  personal projects, this program might be the right thing for you.
</p>
<p>
  If you have just gained a degree (3+ university program), and have done some
  projects (personal, small, bigger etc.), you should apply and then we will
  figure out together if you are fit for a&nbsp;junior position or if you should
  go through an internship program.
</p>
<p>We are always eager to meet people like you.</p>
<p>
  If you have completed the course in PHP, Ruby, or front-end development, you
  <u>must have</u> at least one project that you are proud of. Make it publicly
  available on a Git repo. We want to know how you think, how persistent you
  are, how much time it took you to complete the project, etc.
</p>
<p>
  You should additionally write a motivational letter or (even better) record
  yourself explaining the motivation behind your choices and what you think your
  future will look like if all turns great.
</p>
<h2>How to Apply?</h2>
<p>
  There are many tutorials on how to write or record a great motivational
  letter.
</p>
<p>
  That is why we will not cover this topic, but we should point out that this
  seemingly small step may affect your entire career, and as such, it deserves
  your full attention and dedication.
</p>
<p>
  Naturally, when reading motivational letters, we go for those written on a
  more personal note, those that truly explain what are your motives and
  expectations related to StuntCoders in particular, rather than going for a
  <em>generic-sent-out-to-hundred-companies</em> letter.
</p>
<p>
  So, try to explain why exactly you believe we would be like two peas in a pod!
</p>
<p>
  We also want to know what is the reason behind your decision to pursue this
  career.
</p>
<p>
  We want to know if there are things that keep you awake at night. Tell us as
  much as you can about yourself and technologies that turn you on. Tell us
  about what problems you would like to solve.
</p>
<h2>What does the interview look like?</h2>
<p>
  We reply to all people that apply. If you do not hear from us, it is likely we
  didn’t receive your application. Try reaching us in a different manner.
</p>
<p>
  In case we like your motivational letter, and your project(s), we will invite
  you to our office so we can meet.
</p>
<p>
  There, we will be looking forward to learning more about you, and we will be
  open for any questions that you might have. Our teammates (not more than two),
  will be talking to you about motivation, your current interests, and knowledge
  that you have gained.
</p>
<p>
  All of our questions will depend on your area of interest and current
  knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  The idea here is to learn about how much time should the internship take, and
  what are the areas we should focus on during that time. Strong individuals
  form strong teams and we want you to gain as much as possible from this
  program.
</p>
<p>
  If all turns out to be great on both sides, we will ask you to visit our team
  psychologist for evaluation. This is our standard procedure that ensures you
  will be a&nbsp;great fit for the current team.
</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>
  And not only that, but we push you beyond your comfort zone by giving you hard

  right track.

<h3>Do you hire your interns?</h3>
<p>
  More often than not, we end up hiring software developers that went through
  our program.
</p>
<h3>How many interns do you accept to your program?</h3>
<p>
  One of our mantras is – we are not willing to commit to more than we are sure
  we can handle.
</p>
<p>
  This is our approach with our clients and projects, as well as with interns,
  and we consider it tremendously important.
</p>
<p>
  After all, it is the only way to ensure that the end result will be of highest
  quality.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, we will give you straight and honest answer if we can or can not
  accept you onto our internship program.
</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you. Good luck!</p>
