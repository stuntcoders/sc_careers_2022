title: Ruby on Rails Developer
description: Work at StuntCoders is oriented both on in-house projects as well as client services, and over the years we have developed quite a taste for Ruby on Rail for the few amazing in-house apps that are reaching new heights. Among those are <strong>https://privatni-casovi.net</strong>, LeCollab (our internal PM tool), https://adven.to/, https://flextrainer.ch/, deployment tools, and more. Through a well thought out architecture and cutting-edge technology, we create solutions that change the way consumers interact with brands.
